# MilestonePowershellProfile
This is a profile that can be integrated into powershell, which automatically downloads the necessary modules to extract a lot of data from recording servers and associated cameras, creating a clean CSV.

Some of the features:

The profile shows various actions that can be performed to speed up Milestone's systems integration work.

Here you can find quick scripts to get info about a remote or local pc, restart Milestone services from remote and local.

Keep in mind the version of Powershell on the pc from which you run the scripts as it does not work correctly on all versions, you may need to adjust the scripts according to the powershell version.

Feel free to improve the code as you see fit if it can be useful for other people as well!
